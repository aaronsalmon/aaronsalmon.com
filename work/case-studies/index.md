      <h4>The Challenge</h4>
      <p>The Army had developed the R4 (Behavioral Health Readiness and Suicide Risk Reduction Review) framework - a comprehensive policy for identifying and mitigating suicide risk among soldiers. However, this existed only as policy documentation. My mission was to understand how this framework could actually be implemented throughout the Army and design digital tools that military leaders would adopt and use effectively.</p>

      <h4>Key Deliverables</h4>

      <h4>Key Research Insights</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Leadership Skills Gap</dt>
        <dd>User research revealed that many platoon leaders lack the soft social skills needed for meaningful conversations with soldiers under their command. Promotion in the Army varies greatly - some leaders advance based on technical or tactical skills but struggle with interpersonal connection.</dd>
        
        <dt>Cultural Resistance to Mental Health</dt>
        <dd>Company commanders sometimes didn't view mental health as a priority and expected soldiers to "man up" with a tough-love attitude, seeing support as "coddling" their troops.</dd>
        
        <dt>Expert Burnout</dt>
        <dd>Mental health professionals were resistant to implementing yet another tool, feeling burnt out by previous half-hearted approaches to addressing the crisis.</dd>
        
        <dt>Research Constraints</dt>
        <dd>Had to conduct rank-separated interviews - discovered that no one would share openly in mixed-rank groups due to military hierarchy dynamics.</dd>
        
        <dt>Process Breakdown Points</dt>
        <dd>Journey mapping revealed critical gaps in the identify → document → report → mitigate flow, particularly around consistent documentation and follow-through on interventions.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>The Vision & Challenge</h4>
      <p>As a founding team member, helped create Public Good Software from the ground up with the mission of connecting people to local nonprofits through news consumption. The platform facilitated two distinct user types: individuals creating profiles about their nonprofit passions and interests, and local nonprofits claiming profiles to fundraise and add volunteer actions. The core challenge was building this two-sided marketplace while solving the classic "chicken and egg" problem - requiring valuable offerings to attract both sides simultaneously.</p>

        <dd>Developed sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing systems to automatically match journalistic articles to relevant causes and local nonprofit organizations, scaling from manual curation to processing hundreds of articles daily.</dd>
