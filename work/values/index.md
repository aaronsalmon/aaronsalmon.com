      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <h3>Go Where the Work Is</h3>
      <p>Show up and experience the problem firsthand. From military bases in Iraq to nonprofit offices to campaign headquarters - you can't design solutions from a conference room.</p>

      <h3>Design With Users</h3>
      <p>Meet people where they are, listen to their actual needs, and understand their goals. The best solutions emerge through collaboration with the people who actually use them.</p>

      <h3>Show, Don't Tell</h3>
      <p>Rapidly demonstrate and deliver capabilities. Prototypes, wireframes, and working code speak louder than presentations and promises.</p>

      <h3>Clarity Through Detail</h3>
      <p>"To clarify add detail. Clutter and overload are not an attribute of information. They are failures of design..." - Edward Tufte</p>

      <h3>Embrace Creative Challenge</h3>
      <p>"That's the disease you have to fight in any creative field... ease of use" - Jack White. Push beyond the obvious solution.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="growth" class="content-section">
      <h2>Personal Growth & Leadership</h2>
      <h3>Be Brave and Speak The Truth</h3>
      <p>Tell the truth about systems, capabilities, and processes - even when it's hard to hear. Honest assessment leads to better outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Allow Events to Change You</h3>
      <p>"Allow events to change you. You have to be willing to grow. Growth is different from something that happens to you. You produce it. You live it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience events and the willingness to be changed by them." - From Bruce Mau's "Incomplete Manifesto"</p>

      <h3>Build Colleaguery</h3>
      <p>Foster that spirit of mutual support, joy, and shared purpose that makes teams thrive. Create environments where people are drawn together and everything feels lighter.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="community" class="content-section">
      <h2>Community & Democracy</h2>
      <h3>Active Citizenship</h3>
      <p>"Citizenship â€“ a word at the very heart of our founding, at the very essence of our democracy; the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another, and to future generations." - Barack Obama</p>

      <h3>Inclusive Voices</h3>
      <p>Sustainable solutions come from including community voices from the start - not just the loudest ones. Break down barriers that prevent authentic participation.</p>

      <h3>Ripples of Hope</h3>
      <p>Create positive change that spreads outward. Small actions in local contexts can build toward larger systemic improvements.</p>

      <h3>Generational Stewardship</h3>
      <p>"The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value." - Theodore Roosevelt</p>
    </div>

    <div id="life" class="content-section">
      <h2>Life Philosophy</h2>
      <h3>Connect With Nature</h3>
      <p>"Go forth under the open sky, and list to nature's teachings." - William Cullen Bryant</p>

      <h3>Resilient Perspective</h3>
      <p>"In such hard times I heard the gentle but strong whisper of the Sequoia gigantea: 'Hear me, you poor man. I've stood here more than three thousand years in rain, snow, storm, and even mountain fire still keeping my thankful attitude strongly with nature-do not cry, do not spend your time and energy worrying. You have children following. Keep up your unity; come with me.'" - Chiura Obata</p>

      <h3>"Get to the Choppa" <em>- Dutch</em></h3>
      <p>Listen to Dutch.</p>
