      <h2>Selected Work</h2>
      <p>You'll find a mix of projects here, both recent and from many moons ago. Though I should mention - a good chunk of my work lives in the vault. Between classified projects, sensitive data, and client confidentiality, I can only share pieces of my portfolio. But I've included what I can while keeping everyone's privacy intact.</p>

      <h2>Pentagon Adventures: Championing User-Centered Design at the DoD</h2>
      
      <p>For five years at the Pentagon, I led design for mission-critical projects that directly impacted service members and defense operations. This has been an incredible, mission-driven opportunity - I traveled to military installations and sites around the world to understand user needs firsthand, transforming outdated processes into digital tools that made people's jobs easier.</p>

      <p>I wore a lot of hats as Design Guild Lead, from creating high-fidelity prototypes and building component systems to advising leadership on thorny challenges. Some of my favorite work involved helping defense teams unlock stalled initiatives and guiding consulting designers through the complexities of government projects.</p>

      <p>The big win? Building digital systems that could actually collect meaningful data while keeping everyone aligned on both user needs and mission requirements. My discovery reports often influenced policy decisions, and the systems we built laid groundwork for future modernization efforts. This meant lots of hands-on work - from research and prototyping to getting into the code.</p>

      <p><em>Worth noting: This was a GS-15 position requiring TS/SCI clearance, and while I can't show most of the actual work, I'm happy to chat about my approach to these challenges.</em></p>

      <h2>Public Good Software: Building a Platform for Nonprofit Impact</h2>
      
      <p>As a founding member of Public Good Software, I helped build something pretty special from the ground up. We kicked things off collaborating with Aaron Draplin on our logo, which became the foundation for the full brand system I developed.</p>

      <p>I worked closely with nonprofit partners to understand what they really needed to achieve their missions. Through in-person observations, design sprints, and lots of conversations, we mapped out user journeys that shaped our product roadmap.</p>

      <p>I had my hands in everything from wireframes to final code, building out our platform's interface and maintaining a living style guide that kept our team (and partners) in sync. The best part? Getting to see how our work helped nonprofits make a bigger impact.</p>

      <h2>Obama 2012: Respect, Empower, Include, Win</h2>
      
      <p>My time with the Obama 2012 campaign in Chicago was one of those career-defining experiences that forever changed how I approach design work. As the only designer on the Technology team, I had the crucial responsibility of bridging the Tech and Design departments during one of the most innovative digital campaigns in history.</p>

      <p>I led UX for several high-impact projects including the Call Tool that facilitated over 3 million voter outreach calls and front-end development for the barackobama.com store. My most impactful work was serving as lead UX and Front-End Engineer on 'Dashboard' – our complex online field organizer platform that powered the campaign's ground game across the country. We incorporated proven organizing strategies like the Snowflake Model of Community Engagement and the Ladder of Engagement directly into the platform's architecture.</p>

      <p>I led design support and front-end engineering for ~70 branded tech projects, creating high-fidelity designs, components, templates, and maintaining a code-based styleguide and HTML/CSS DesignOps framework that empowered our engineering department to build consistent experiences. This meant styling multiple web applications to 'Obama for America' design specs with careful attention to responsive design, load times, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.</p>

      <p>I helped maintain our culture of experimentation by supporting A/B testing for donation pages, event registration, and other high-impact areas. Everything from page weight and load times to copy changes, button colors, and layouts were rigorously tested to optimize performance - and always top of mind.</p>

      <p>Working closely with the Director of UX, I helped define these projects and align them with overarching field operation goals through personas, wireframes, and prototypes. The pace was intense, the stakes were high, and the bar was permanently raised for me. As my UX Director and now good friend Jason Kunesh said, "After the President hugs you and tells you that he expects you to carry on his legacy, it's tricky to re-enter the world you once knew."</p>

      <p>The lessons I learned about community organizing, creating efficient design processes, and building bridges between teams have stayed with me ever since.</p>

      <h2>SHIFT</h2>
      <p>Where Coffee, Bikes, and Community Meet</p>
      <p>When I'm not designing digital experiences, you can find me drinking coffee and at the bike bar at SHIFT Cyclery & Coffee Bar, the shop I co-own in downtown Eau Claire. This place is my passion project – equal parts bike repair shop, craft coffee spot, and community hangout.</p>
      <p>I've always been a bit obsessed with cycling advocacy and urban infrastructure (You can't ride your bike in a city without becoming aware of social justice issues). Beyond the shop, I've channeled that energy into serving as Chair of the city's Bicycle & Pedestrian Advisory Committee, and sitting on the boards of both Bike Chippewa Valley and the Chippewa Valley Transit Alliance. SHIFT became another way to make an impact on my hometown alongside these civic roles.</p>
      <p>Working with my two partners, we've created this little hub that's become a cherished part of Eau Claire's revival story. Building community happens in all sorts of ways – sometimes it's through digital platforms, and sometimes it's through creating physical spaces where people connect over caffeine and spokes.</p>

      <p>From Whiteboard to 'Best in Show': Designing FRAIGHT AI's Interface</p>
      <p>The team at FRAIGHT AI (now CoLane) was building something  an AI logistics system named Archie that could communicate with truckers who weren't exactly tech enthusiasts. They brought me in to design Archie's visual platform - basically giving a face to their AI and creating a system to track and task everything Archie-related.</p>
      <p>I kicked things off by spending a week embedded with the team and users, watching workflows, conducting interviews, and covering whiteboards with ideas. From there, I developed a Slack-inspired interface for interacting with Archie, focusing on making complex AI interactions feel natural. The key insight? Instead of forcing truckers to adopt new tech, we met them where they were - using familiar channels like email and SMS.</p>
      <p>The timeline was tight - we needed medium-fidelity wireframes that could be implemented quickly for a major industry demo. The hard work paid off when Archie won 'Best in Show' at the FreightWaves conference!</p>

      <h2>Food Genius</h2>
      <p>Making Data Digestible for the Food Industry</p>
      <p>At Food Genius, I designed and built a new website to showcase their division while also working on how foodservice data was visualized and utilized before their successful acquisition by US Foods. Working with their innovative team, the challenge was great: how do you present detailed insights about menu trends, product pricing, and even burger topping statistics in ways that drive real business decisions?</p>
      <p>My wireframes focused on turning messy foodservice data into clear, actionable insights that sales teams and customers could actually use. This work supported Food Genius's evolution from a startup analyzing menu trends to becoming US Foods' innovative R&D lab in Chicago's West Loop.</p>

      <h2>Colleaguery: Design Highlights from 25 Years in the Trenches</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Professionalism begets colleaguery, that spirit of mutual support and collective identity that contributes so potently to creative exchange and the sense of progress. It's my responsibility to engender this spirit by setting an amiable, stimulating, creative and professional example." - Yuri Rasovsky
      </blockquote>
      <p>This section is a bit of a time capsule – screenshots and snippets from favorite projects spanning my 25-year journey in design. Some of these are from way back in the internet boom when I was helping folks get online for the very first time. Others come from e-learning platforms, corporate redesigns, or startup adventures from my years in Chicago.</p>
      <p>What ties these projects together isn't just that I'm proud of how they look – it's the variety of ways I've worked. Sometimes I was the one-man-army consultant, tackling everything from strategy to implementation. In other roles, I've led web and design departments at various companies, building teams and establishing processes that elevated the quality of work across the organization. I've built and mentored design teams, worked within massive corporate structures, and thrived in scrappy startups. I deeply value the connections I've made over the course of my career and have been honored to work with so many talented and passionate people over the years.</p>
      <p>These screenshots might be from different eras, but they represent the consistent thread through my career: creating thoughtful and well-designed user-centered experiences no matter the context, team structure, visual design trends, or technology of the moment.</p>
