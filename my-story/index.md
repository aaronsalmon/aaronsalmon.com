# My Story

I'm a User Experience Designer/Developer based out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I've been designing and developing for the web since 2001. I've worked with a variety of clients, from small businesses to large corporations, and everything in between.

I'm passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites and applications. I believe in the power of design to solve problems and make people's lives better.

When I'm not designing or coding, you can find me spending time with my family, playing music, or exploring the great outdoors.
