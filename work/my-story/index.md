      <h2>The Origin Story '75 - '99</h2>
      <p>I was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin to a couple of amazing anti-establishment hippies. I grew up in the country in a very homestead'y way. My Dad owned his own siding business and my Mom was a high school art teacher. In the late 90s I drove a forklift and in my spare time ran a BBS and learned web design to build a number of fun experiments as well as my Quake II clan's website (which clears throat won a number of Website Of The Day awards :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:) and led me to professional freelance work.</p>

      <h2>The Chicago Years '00 - '15</h2>
      <p>Moved to Chicago with two other web design friends - we all got hired at the same eCommerce company during the dotcom boom. I worked at a variety of Design/Marketing/Instructional Design companies with amazing colleagues over the years and was heavily involved in the Chicago tech and startup scene. Was hired onto the Obama 2012 Tech Team at campaign HQ for 1.5 years. Was captain of an APA pool team for the Gold Star Bar for 8 years. Fell in love with my bike, bike commuting and bike advocacy. Founded a community garden on the northside of Chicago. Was on the founding team of a startup called Public Good - working on software and advocacy tools for nonprofits and their champions.</p>

      <h2>Up North '15 - '20</h2>
      <p>I moved back to Eau Claire in '15 for a change of pace, to help my parents, help revitalize my town and experience new opportunities. Worked on satisfying remote projects: Scripps hospital network, Four Seasons Hotels/Resorts, USFOODS, Ventra Chicago and more. I opened a bike/coffee shop downtown called 'SHIFT Cyclery & Coffee Bar' to serve as the hub of the local bike scene, build community and provide space for local nonprofits, political organizing and advocacy groups. Started a Code For America Brigade here. Chaired the City of Eau Claire's Bike & Pedestrian Advisory Commission. Served on the board of three nonprofits focused on civic engagement and bike & transit advocacy. Was on my neighborhood's steering committee (usually having heated discussions about roundabouts and parking). Could usually be found working the free bike valet at our river concerts or out on the riverbanks and sand bars with my two 'lil boys.</p>

      <h2>The New Hottness '20 - '25</h2>
      <p>At the very beginning of the COVID Quarantine I joined the Defense Digital Service at the Pentagon, where I spent 5 incredible years working on some of the most challenging and impactful UX problems imaginable. Led design and research on everything from suicide prevention tools for military leaders to AI-powered logistics systems mandated by Congress. Did field research all over the world. Received challenge coins, company patches, and shoutouts from the Secretary of Defense - a long way from my Quake II clan website days.</p>
      <p>DDS was special to me in a number of ways. During my second trip to the Pentagon my Dad passed away - He was so proud of me. I poured everything into my work and it was incredible being at the tip of the Digital Services movement within Government with our friends at USDS and 18f. Proud of what we accomplished – spreading Human-Centered Design principles and approaches throughout the government - we really did move the needle.</p>
      <p>Also part of this hottness was getting engaged to my lovely partner (and high school art teacher, like my mom) and have really never been happier. Together my family has been transforming our house together through DIY remodeling projects and brute-force landscaping adventures. I'm teaching my two growing boys to fish and kayak on the Chippewa River.</p>
      <p>I'm still deeply involved in civic life - continuing my work on bike advocacy, serving nonprofits, and still occasionally getting into heated neighborhood discussions about parking. The work at DDS reinforced the idea that, whether you're solving national security challenges or local advocacy issues, it all comes down to understanding people where they're at and designing systems that actually work for them.</p>
      <p>Oh, music is a <em>very</em> big deal to me (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/122305252?si=ecsi1DrhQkygJ1YR6wjPBA">Spotify</a>), I'm also a fan of coffee (obvi), frisbee, d&d, basketball, pool, and whiskey.</p>
      <p>Cheers to new chapters and ripples of hope – ONWARD!</p>
